# 🎨 **Phase 5+ — UI Polish Sprint Plan**

**Goal:**
Make the workflow editor *feel production-grade* through interaction, feedback, and usability polish — no major refactors.

**Duration:** ~2 days
**Owner:** Frontend / Product Engineer
**Status:** 🟡 Ready to Start (Phase 4 Complete ✅)

**Note:** Phase 4 is complete! AI Assistant with backend integration fully working. Some Phase 5 features are already implemented. See status updates below.

## 🎉 **Already Implemented (Phase 1-4)**

These features were built during the Phase 1-4 migration and are **already working**:

✅ **Autosave** - workflowStore.ts has debounced auto-save (500ms delay)
✅ **Toast Notifications** - uiStore.showToast() used throughout (success, error, info)
✅ **Loading States** - Analyze button shows spinner, AI assistant has typing indicator
✅ **Status Colors** - Nodes show blue (idle), yellow (analyzing), green (completed), red (error)
✅ **Responsive Layout** - Inspector panel slides in/out, canvas resizes
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Node label editing, content editing with visual feedback
✅ **Error Handling** - Try/catch blocks, error messages displayed
✅ **Smooth Animations** - 300ms transitions, fade in/out effects

**Result:** ~80% of "Day 1" is already done! Only snap-to-grid remains.
