Based on the following interview analysis data, create an AGGRESSIVE, PROJECT-BASED 30-DAY learning sprint for modern job seekers who don't have time for long-term preparation:

**THE REALITY FOR YOUNG PROFESSIONALS TODAY:**
- Traditional 6-month study plans are outdated for the AI-assisted era
- Young people need to SHIP PROJECTS, not just study theory
- Modern tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, v0.dev, Supabase, Vercel) enable 10x faster learning
- Companies care more about what you've BUILT than what you've studied

**Analysis Summary:**
- Total interview posts analyzed: ${insights.total_posts}
- Companies mentioned: ${topCompanies}
- Roles targeted: ${topRoles}
- Key skills mentioned: ${topSkills}
- Success rate: ${(insights.success_rate * 100 || 0).toFixed(1)}%

**User Goals:**
- Target role: ${userGoals.target_role || 'Not specified'}
- Target companies: ${userGoals.target_companies ? userGoals.target_companies.join(', ') : 'Not specified'}
- Experience level: ${userGoals.current_level || 'Intermediate'}
- Timeline: 30 DAYS (CrazyPlan)

**CRAZYPLAN PHILOSOPHY:**
1. BUILD 2-3 PORTFOLIO PROJECTS that directly relate to ${userGoals.target_role || 'your target role'}
2. Use AI tools to accelerate development (ChatGPT for architecture, Cursor for coding, v0 for UI)
3. Deploy LIVE projects (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io) - no localhost portfolios
4. Document your learning journey on Twitter/LinkedIn
5. Focus on SHIPPING over perfection

**Instructions:**
Create a JSON-formatted CRAZYPLAN learning map with 4 weeks of aggressive, project-focused milestones:

  "next_steps": [
    "Share projects on Twitter/LinkedIn with #BuildInPublic",
    "Apply to companies with portfolio links in resume",
    "Continue iterating on projects based on feedback"
  ]
}

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CRAZYPLAN:**
- Each milestone MUST include a concrete PROJECT to build
- Recommend specific AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, v0, Copilot) for acceleration
- Focus on SHIPPING and DEPLOYMENT, not just coding
- Include modern no-code/low-code tools where appropriate (Supabase, Firebase, Convex)
- Emphasize building in public and documenting the journey
- Projects should relate to the ${topSkills} skills and ${topRoles} roles from analysis
- Make it realistic but challenging - young people can move FAST with AI tools
