# LabZero: Career Intelligence That Actually Works

## The Problem We Solve

**You're preparing for interviews. You're stressed. You need real answers.**

- "What questions does Amazon actually ask?"
- "Is the Google interview really that hard?"
- "What salary should I expect at a Series B startup?"
- "What skills do I actually need for this role?"

You scroll through Reddit for hours. Hundreds of posts. Conflicting information. No structure. No way to know what's relevant to YOUR situation.

**LabZero changes that.**

---

## What LabZero Does (In Plain English)

### 1. We Read Reddit So You Don't Have To

We continuously collect interview experiences from communities like r/cscareerquestions and r/experienceddevs. Real stories from real people who just went through what you're about to face.

### 2. We Extract What Matters

Our AI reads every post and pulls out:
- **Companies mentioned** (and whether people liked working there)
- **Interview questions** (actual questions people were asked)
- **Skills required** (what you need to know)
- **Salary data** (real numbers, not recruiter fluff)
- **Red flags** (what to watch out for)

### 3. We Make It Searchable

Ask questions like a human:
- "What's the Amazon SDE interview like?"
- "Companies with good work-life balance"
- "Python developer salaries in NYC"

Our AI understands what you mean and finds relevant experiences.

### 4. We Generate Reports

One click. Beautiful, actionable reports with:
- Top skills to focus on
- Common interview patterns
- Salary benchmarks
- Company sentiment analysis
- Learning roadmaps
