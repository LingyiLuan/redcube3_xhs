# API Gateway - Railway Environment Variables
# Paste this into Railway's "Raw Editor" for api-gateway
# ============================================
#
# API Gateway is an Nginx reverse proxy.
# It routes requests to backend services.
#
# Nginx doesn't use environment variables - it uses nginx.conf for configuration.
# Railway will handle service discovery automatically via internal networking.
#
# No environment variables are required for API Gateway.
# The nginx.conf file handles all routing configuration.
#
# If Railway requires at least one variable, you can leave this file empty
# or add a comment variable (Railway will ignore it):
# COMMENT=API Gateway uses nginx.conf for configuration, no env vars needed
