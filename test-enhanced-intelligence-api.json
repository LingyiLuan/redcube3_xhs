      "text": "Just finished my Google interview process. Had 5 rounds total - 2 phone screens, 1 coding round, and 2 onsite (behavioral + system design). They asked me to reverse a linked list and design a URL shortener. Got rejected after behavioral round, feedback was that I didn't demonstrate enough leadership experience. The whole process took about 6 weeks. No referral, applied directly through their careers page."
