  - Input validation with Joi
  - Error handling and logging
- ✅ Designed scalable architecture for future features

### HOUR 2: Database Schema for Analysis Results ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ Created analysis_results table in shared/database/init/02-create-tables.sql
- ✅ Designed schema with future scalability:
  - Core fields: company, role, sentiment, interview_topics
  - JSONB fields for complex data (topics, materials, insights)
  - Future-ready fields: analysis_version, confidence_score, metadata
  - Commented future tables (post_connections, learning_paths)
- ✅ Added comprehensive indexes for performance
- ✅ Updated .env.example with OpenAI configuration

### HOUR 3: React Frontend Development ✅
**Completed:**

  - Sample XHS posts for testing
  - Real-time analysis results display
  - History section showing past analyses
  - Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Added frontend to docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Configured API integration via axios

### HOUR 4: Testing & Documentation ✅
**Completed:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - Quick start guide
  - Architecture overview
  - API documentation
  - Testing instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Built structure validation script (test-api-structure.js)
- ✅ Created detailed DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- ✅ Validated all configurations and file structures
- ✅ Verified microservices architecture integrity

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Delivered

### Microservices Stack
```
Frontend (React) → API Gateway (Nginx) → Content Service (Node.js + OpenAI)
                                      ↓
            PostgreSQL ← Redis ← Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
```
